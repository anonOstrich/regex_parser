Implementation document
=======================

General structure
-----------------
Roughly as described in the design document. No major changes, since the vision was clearly laid out and manageable to implement. 

Achieved space complexity
-------------------------

Achieved time complexity
------------------------


Suggestions for improvement
---------------------------
* Implement also by backtracking method and offer new funcionality afforded that way.
* Allow more characters than alphabets and letters: also an escape character, so that operation symbols can be used also as alphabet symbols.
