Week 6
======

Accomplished this week
----------------------


Advancement of program
----------------------
* Only Strings remain as the default data structure.
* UI requires fewer operations to use comfortably
* Extended testing to cover all classes
* Building creates a .jar file that contains the main class and all the files in /src/main/resources/
* Building the project creates updated JavaDoc outside target folder, so there is no need to manually update the files each time


Sources of difficulty/frustration
---------------------------------
 Packaging into a .jar file that contains all the functionality proved harder than expected. I had to research maven more in-depth than I had previously done. I understand why å, ä, ö are so often not supported, having now had my share of problems with supporting proper encoding in different environments. 


To do next
----------


Time spent on the project
-------------------------

15.10. 
1h replaced StringBuilder with own implementation
0,5h added functionality to the UI

16.10. 
2h wrote tests for TextUI and OwnStringBuilder
4h building creates a useful .jar file and JavaDoc. Encoding of weird characters works regardless of running environment.
